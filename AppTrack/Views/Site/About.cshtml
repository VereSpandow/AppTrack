                <p>
                    AppTrack is a next generation app designed to combine the features and functionality of several apps into one centralized tool to help you remember where you've been and where your going.
                    <br /><br />
                    Imagine being able to instantly recall when you called to cancel a service, who you spoke to and what they said!  The next time a customer service agent asks you wait while they pull up your account, you can ask them to wait while you pull up theirs!
                    <br /><br />
                    Imagine knowing when you bought that tablet, where and what you paid...and having a digital copy of the receipt!
                    <br /><br />
                    Imagine your personal trainer sharing their latest workout track with you, so you know exactly when, what and how to complete your customized workout.
                    <br /><br />
                    Imagine no more...with AppTrack this is all not only possible but easy and fun!
