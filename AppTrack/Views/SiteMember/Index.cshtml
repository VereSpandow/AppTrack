            <br /><br />
            Click on the little person icon to the right to view their Profile. You can edit their information, add Contacts or the best part track Activities.
            <br /><br />
            Activities are any interaction that you want to track like a purchase, or customer service issue or service appointment.
            <br /><br />
            Each Activity can have either Notes or Tasks.  Notes can be anything about that Activity you want to remember. Tasks are just that things you need to do related to this Activity that typically have a due date.
